				<h6>Email tracking pixel and Visitor Tracking</h6>

				<p>There's few thing worst then sending out your resume / cover letter / portfolio and having to just wait and see what happends.</p>
				<p>Did they get the email? Did they open it? Did they look at my portfolio?</p>
				<p>After sending out a round of job application and only hearing back from a few, I decided to use the knowledge I have on email creation and deployment and apply it to my job search practise.</p>
				<p>First, I created a small MySQL database with a single table that held information such as name, visit counter, email opened, last visit e.t.c</p>
				<p>I then created a PHP tracking pixel that triggers when images are downloaded on my email job applications. This would update the database record for the job I'm applying to with the date they first opened the email.</p>
				<p>I also made it so that any links to my portfolio in my email was encoded with the "visitor ID" that corresenponded to the record in my database that would then create a tracking cookie</p>
				<p>After that, I created a Javascript function that calls to a PHP script that returns a JSON string that has all the visitors information.</p>
				<p>From there I could use the visitor data to display different messages such bas how many time a certain visitor has been to the site, company name or last time visit</p>
