	<div class="project-wrapper">
			<p>Now that I have a few more projects to display on my site, it was getting difficult to keep track of everything in one single file. I could have created a templating system in either PHP or Javascript, however, I've been hearing a lot about blog aware static page generators that give you the benefit of a static pages without having to hand code each file.</p>
			<p>After looking over how <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> laid out it's structure, I decided to build my own grunt script using similar concepts. I currently have it working for projects but I also plan to use it for my eventual blog as well.</p>

				<h6>Static Page Templating</h6>
				<p>The first thing I needed to do was create a few new directories:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>_projects:</strong> Where the project snippets go</li>
				<li><strong>_posts:</strong> Where the (eventual) blog posts will go</li>
				<li><strong>_templates:</strong> Where the main index.html template go</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The template file contains templating variables, at the moment, only <strong>{{PROJECTS}}</strong>. This is where the projects .html files  contained in <strong>"_PROJECTS"</strong> will be inserted</p>
				<p>Next I created a grunt task that reads in all the files in the <strong>"_PROJECTS"</strong> folder. Using the concepts used in <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jykyll</a>, I named all my project files starting with the date they were created followed by tge project name. For example this file is named <strong>"11-11-2013-static-page-templating.html"</strong> What this lets me do is sort the file in order of date from newest to oldest.</p>
				<p>With all the project .html files read into a single variable, I'm able to do a simple search and replace using the primary template file then write this new file to index.html in the primary directory.</p>
				<p>At any point if I want to add a new project snippet, I just need to save it to the <strong>"_PROJECTS"</strong> directory and run grunt and it will be added in order with the rest of the projects.</p>
				<p>The steps are essentially the same for the blog however, I haven't yet figured out how I want to handle my blog. That's a project for another day.</p>
