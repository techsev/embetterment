				<h6>Dynamic Progress Bars using live data</h6>
				<h7>Oct 10th, 2013</h7>
				<p>Now that I’ve created the progress tracker, I wanted to be able to update it in a few different ways. </p>
				<ul class="show-list">
					<li>I want to be able to just change a variable at any time manually.</li>
					<li>I want to be able to add an project entry to my site that will increase my progress by adding the original value plus my gained “experience”, like a role playing game.</li>
					<li>I want to be able have certain progress bars be updated by referencing certain APIs and other resources.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Option 1 was doable but not to my liking, rather not have to open a scss file for each change, but for now it’s manageable.</p>

				<p>Option 2 will be trickier, since I’m not planning to have the site use any back end database. I will get to this one later.</p>

				<p>So I’ve decided to work on option 3 for now. I’m going to use node.js and grunt to pull data from twitter to update my weight progress.</p>

				<p>Ideally I wanted to have grunt pull the data from the web service “My Fitness Pal” since I currently use it to track my weight progress, however, their API tools are currently private. However, they do allow for automatic posting to twitter, so I created a twitter account, “SeveIsFat” that was exclusively for this purpose. From there I created a node.js script that pulls the most recent tweet on my account, strips the everything but the amount of weight I’ve lost since I started tracking, and updates a file that holds exclusively that variable which then gets include imported into my <code>_progress.scss</code> file, which is where all my current progress goal variables are saved.</p>

				<p>Once / If I get the My fitness Pal API keys I’ll update this to allow for a direct link to the data, but for now it’s the best I could think of.</p>
