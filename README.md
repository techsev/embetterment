Version 1.0
Date: 2013-10-22

Created the first section of the site, my personal and carreer progress tracker. I used SASS and Compass to create a static page that using a few mixins and math variables was able to have easy to customize progress bars. I also created a pen on www.codepen.io and embed it on the site show how I created it. I used a bunch of different carreer and life goals that, if you were to look in the `_progress.scss` file here on github, you might find entertaining.  


To do next: Node.js + Grunt.js to updated certain progress based on outside variables and api calls
