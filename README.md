#The Betterment of Seve#
Version: 1.0

Hi, my name is Seve Teruel, I’m an up and coming Web developer working just outside of Toronto and living even further outside of Toronto. I’ve spent the last year working for a ‘publishing’ company that mainly deals with selling financial and health publications through less then honest email campaigns using email addresses that may or may not be acquired through best practice.  

Basically, we send spam.

Or at least that’s where most of the emails end up. The company also has a Web Development & SEO shop on the side that I will also work on. Unfortunately, since the most important thing is getting the client to sign on for a monthly SEO budget and less about the website, We end up just selling Wordpress sites using free / cheap themes. 

Even the custom Wordpress sites I do get to work on end up getting rushed out the door before they are fully cross browser tested and optimized. 

Also, the only software they provided me to work with was Adobe Dreamweaver...

...CS4... 

So basically, I’m looking for something else. 

The problem is I don’t have much work that I’m proud of, which makes it very difficult to impress potential employers. So what to do?

I’ve been listening to lots of different web development podcasts as of late, so that I can know what I don’t know, and learn it. Stuff like CSS preprocessors, NODE.js, Responsive images. e.t.c. I’ve been dying to try out these new tech trends on projects at work, however, I’m never given the proper time to implement things. So instead I decided to build this website as a sandbox to try out ideas as well as a showcase of the skills I do have. 

Am I crazy for telling you all of this? Yeah probably, but I’d rather be upfront about my situation and let you make your decision.

if you have any further questions for me, feel free to email me at techsev@gmail.com

Created the first section of the site, my personal and carreer progress tracker. I used SASS and Compass to create a static page that using a few mixins and math variables was able to have easy to customize progress bars. I also created a pen on www.codepen.io and embed it on the site show how I created it. I used a bunch of different carreer and life goals that, if you were to look in the `_progress.scss` file here on github, you might find entertaining.
